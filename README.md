The source for [zhili-liu.com](https://zhili-liu.com). The website is built from Jekyll website builder.

## Adding pages

### Blog posts

1. Create a new file in `_posts` for the new blog post. The file
   name begins with the date followed by a name that shows in the
   URL.
   
   The easiest way to do this to copy an existing post and then
   rename the file.
2. Open the file you created and edit the information in the header.
   
   That's the part at the top between the first `---` and the second
   `---`.
3. Create a picture for the blog post. The size should be
   1280 x 720 px (but doesn't be). The picture MUST go into the folder `assets\blog`.
   
   Give it a descriptive name so that you remember what the name is.
   
   Take note of the file extension. It is a `.png` or `.jpg` file.

   In the header section, make sure that `post-image` has the right file name.
